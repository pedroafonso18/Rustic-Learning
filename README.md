# Rustic Learning

A personal journey of learning the Rust programming language through practical examples.

## Project Structure

This repository contains various small projects and examples to explore Rust's features:

- **hello_world**: The classic first program in any language
- **hello_cargo**: Introduction to Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system
- **variables**: Exploring Rust's variable system, including shadowing and scope
- **guessing_game**: A simple number guessing game demonstrating user input, randomness, and control flow

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Running the Examples

### Hello World (Simple)

```bash
cd hello_world
rustc main.rs
./main # or main.exe on Windows
```

### Hello Cargo

```bash
cd hello_cargo
cargo run
```

### Variables

```bash
cd variables
cargo run
```

### Guessing Game

```bash
cd guessing_game
cargo run
```

## What I'm Learning

- Basic Rust syntax
- Variables and mutability
- Data types and functions
- Control flow (if/else, match, loops)
- Package management with Cargo
- Error handling
- Standard library features

## Conclusion

## Conclusion

Despite being an experienced developer, I'm deliberately starting from the basics with Rust. This approach helps build a solid foundation and ensures I fully understand the language's unique features and idiomatic patterns. Through these simple projects, I'm gaining appreciation for Rust's focus on memory safety without garbage collection, its expressive type system, and its modern tooling. As I progress, I'll continue building more complex applications while maintaining the careful, thoughtful approach that Rust encourages.
