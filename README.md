# Rustic Learning

A personal journey of learning the Rust programming language through practical examples.

## Project Structure

This repository contains various small projects and examples to explore Rust's features:

- **hello_world**: The classic first program in any language
- **hello_cargo**: Introduction to Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system
- **variables**: Exploring Rust's variable system, including shadowing and scope
- **guessing_game**: A simple number guessing game demonstrating user input, randomness, and control flow

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Running the Examples

### Hello World (Simple)

```bash
cd hello_world
rustc main.rs
./main # or main.exe on Windows
```

### Hello Cargo

```bash
cd hello_cargo
cargo run
```

### Variables

```bash
cd variables
cargo run
```

### Guessing Game

```bash
cd guessing_game
cargo run
```

## What I'm Learning

- Basic Rust syntax
- Variables and mutability
- Data types and functions
- Control flow (if/else, match, loops)
- Package management with Cargo
- Error handling
- Standard library features
